# JSFinalProject

OVERVIEW

The application I will be building for my final project is one that lets users see a 30-day workout plan and meal plans displayed on the web page. The user will have the ability to click "complete" on the page for each week once workout plan and meal plans are followed. When all 30-days are completed, the user will get a badge saying "Congrats! You did it"

UI DRAFT

My application will have the following views:
- The home page will welcome the user and have a button that says "enter"

- On top of the page it will say "Wanna lose 30lbs?"

- Then there will be a list of meals and workout plans to follow for the 30-day mark period and there will be a "complete" button at the end of each week for users to click.

- Once all is completed(when all complete buttons are clicked), the user will then receive a popup badge that says "Congrats, you won a gift card". 


TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

My app will use the following packages:
- Express
- Express handlebars
- Mongoose
- Nodemon
- Food API 
- OpenfitAPI

FEATURES

- The webpage will welcome users and have a button that says "enter" for the user to click to navigate to the meal/workout plan page.

- The meal/workout plan page will have a list of meals and workout plans to follow for the 30-day mark period (Mon-Sun) to be exact. The list will contain the kinds of meals users should consume and the workout plan they should follow in order to reach the goal of loosing the weight set (on top of page). 

- Then there will be a green "complete" button at the end of each week on the right side of the page, enabling users to click on it and have the meal plan and workout plan blurred out/blocked. The button will then change to "completed".
